# Project Title

Analysing differennt Vehicle types with Linear Regression

This dataset was created to highlight different vehicle brands in Nigeria using Linear Regression to analyse their actual price against their predicted price
Highlights of this project include
1.Importing different Machine Learning libraries like pandas,numpy and visualisation tools
like Matplotlib and seaborn to find variation and correlation between the different values
2.Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA)was performed on the dataset to retrieve the dataset,check for null values
and
3.Categorical values was converted to numerical values through manual encoding
and one-hot encoder
4.After which the dataset was broken into dependent and independent
variables and splitted into train and test to do a 
predictive analysis on the dataset
5.An Heatmap was used to visualise the correlation between the different columns
in the dataset and also and a matplotlib was used to find the correlation between the present
price and the selling prices.
